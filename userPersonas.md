* I'm a die-hard Stephen King fan and have read around half of his books. I would love an app where I can add some of his books to a read me list and also have a complete book list to keep track of the books of his I've finished. (Young adult age)

* I'm an avid reader and love a good book, but I am not a fan of horror novels. They give me nightmares so I steer clear, but I recently heard that Stephen King has written novels in different genres. I would love to see the options that are out there for crime or fantasy. (Middle age)
